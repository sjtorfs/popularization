<p>Like the Moon orbits the Earth, the Earth orbits the Sun, and the Sun orbits a black hole. Where the moon is the sole companion of the Earth, the Earth has to share the Sun with at least seven other planets. And the Sun? Well, it has to share the black hole with billions of other stars. This huge collection of stars is called a galaxy. Our own galaxy is called the Milky Way, but there are plenty of other galaxies out there. It is not possible to count them all, but estimates suggest there are at least one hundred billion of them.</p>

<p>Unless you live in a very remote place, it is very unlikely you can see even the brightest one with the naked eye. Galaxies are so dim they can only be seen with a telescope. Using a telescope offers another big advantage: it allows you to see "colors" that cannot be detected by the human eye, such as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) light. Detecting these additional colors is very useful. If you compare a galaxy to a smoothie, you will realise that the color says a lot about the content. If your smoothie is green, you might assume that it contains a lot of kiwi; if it is red, it could very well contain strawberries. The same goes for a galaxy. If a galaxy is bright in UV light, it contains many young stars. If it is bright in IR light, it contains a lot of dust. Detecting these colors can therefore give us additional information about the content of a galaxy.</p>

<p>There is one specific shade of IR light that is extremely difficult to detect. This is called the far infrared (FIR). When arranging all colors in the order of the rainbow, this is the part of the IR range that is the furthest from the optical colors. The first big problem with this FIR light is that the atmosphere of the Earth blocks it, making it visible only from space. Although this is obviously an expensive endeavour, many telescopes have already been launched into space. The second big problem is that FIR telescopes have a very limited lifetime due to technical difficulties that cannot be avoided. They usually last no more than a couple of years. At the moment there is no such telescope operational, so no new FIR observations can be made at this time.</p>

<p>This summons the question of whether we really need to observe this FIR light. Can we not find the same information about a galaxy in a different way? If you observe a galaxy in the UV, optical and IR range, can you not make a guess of what the FIR value will be? The answer is yes. You can make such a guess based on the other observations; or at least a computer can, thanks to machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers get to learn from data. For example, you could show a computer a series of handwritten digits and then tell it which digits they are. After seeing enough examples the computer becomes capable of recognizing handwritten digits on its own. The same principle can be used for predicting the FIR. We collect a series of galaxies for which the FIR was already observed by an old space telescope. We show these to the computer along with the observations for the other colors. Then, after seeing enough examples, the computer will be able to estimate the FIR value with reasonable accuracy based on the other colors.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION</span></h3>

<p>Now let’s make this a bit more concrete. The plot below shows the so-called spectral energy distribution of a galaxy. The x-axis shows a range of twenty broadbands. Broadbands are a wide range of colors for which the total light can be observed by a telescope. In the plot below they are arranged in the order of the rainbow. From left to right these broadbands are: two UV bands, five optical bands, and thirteen in the IR range. The last five of these are FIR bands. The y-axis shows the amount of light detected for each band. Notice that the curve starts low. This means that there is not a lot of UV light detected. Going further towards the optical, the curve rises. That is because most stars emit light in this range. When moving into the IR range, the curve drops again, but it reaches another sudden peak in the FIR range. This second peak is caused by dust in galaxies, which emits mainly FIR light.</p>

<p>Now that you know what a galaxy is and how it is characterised by its spectral energy distribution, we will try to create our own galaxy in three steps.</p>

<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Step 1: Choosing the input</span></h5>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at the spectral energy distribution of the first fifteen bands. With the sliders on the right you can choose the shape of the curve. This can be anything you like, we are creating our own galaxy after all. As there are fifteen bands, there technically could have been fifteen sliders, but with that much control over the exact shape of the curve the result would turn into an extremely unrealistic galaxy very soon. The sliders allow you to change three bands, one in the UV, one in the optical, and one in the IR range. The other bands will just follow along and take whatever value that keeps the galaxy somewhat realistic.</p>

<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Step 2: Predicting the far infrared</span></h5>

<p>In the next step we add the FIR light to the curve. It is now up to the computer to estimate what the FIR value is going to be, based on the other fifteen bands that we chose as input. To be able to do this, the computer has taken a look at over 7000 galaxies for which the FIR value was already known. We can now present it with our self-made galaxy and see what it outputs for the FIR.</p>

<script src="fir.js" id="a62bfbde-a9c4-40f2-b087-9738d2e12922"></script>

<p>Notice that whatever you enter as input, the second peak always comes back. It looks like the computer has learned that this is a physically important feature. You can also notice that the FIR value seems to change the most when you change the UV input value. This turns out to be another physically motivated relation.</p>

<h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Step 3: Comparing to real galaxies</span></h5>

<p>In the final step you can compare your galaxy with a collection of real galaxies. The plots below show the UV, optical and IR values for a set of observed galaxies. You can see that they group together. This means that not just any combination of the three bands is physically realistic. The red cross on these plots indicates the location of your galaxy. If it is nowhere near the group of real ones it means your galaxy is unlikely to really exist.</p>
